>In *Philosophy: Who Needs It*, a collection of essays written by [[Ayn Rand|Rand]] in the years following *[[AS|Atlas Shrugged]]*, she argues that [[Philosophy|philosophy]] is not a pastime for brooding teenagers or ivory tower intellectuals. It’s a subject that deals with some of the most important issues in human life. [[Metaphysics|What kind of world do we live in?]] [[Epistemology|How do we separate knowledge from error?]] [[Ethics|What is good and what is evil?]]

>In Rand’s view, we cannot avoid having—and acting on—some answer to these questions.
>
>“Your only choice is whether you define your philosophy by a [[Consciousness|conscious]], [[Reason|rational]], disciplined process of [[Thought|thought]] and scrupulously [[Logic|logical]] deliberation—or let your subconscious accumulate a junk heap of unwarranted conclusions, false generalizations, undefined contradictions, undigested slogans, unidentified wishes, doubts and fears, thrown together by chance, but integrated by your subconscious into a kind of mongrel philosophy and fused into a single, solid weight: _self-doubt_.”[^1]
