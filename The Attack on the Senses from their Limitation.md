Various philosophers ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], #todo: add more examples as they come up, would be good to have at least 3), have throughout the course of history attacked the senses on the grounds that they are limited, concluding that they are therefore invalid. This, of course, ignores that:
1. [[The Validation of Sense Perception|the senses are valid]];
2. [[The Senses Do Not Distort|the senses don't distort]], and;
3. [[The Invalidity of the Senses Implies The Invalidity of Knowledge|if the senses are invalid then so is knowledge]], among other things.

What these theorists miss most importantly is that [[Omnipotence|everything that exists is limited]], what they seek is non-real sensory capabilities---supernatural capabilities for man. The following is a list of some influential instances of the fallacy of attacking the senses from being limited:
+ [[The Attack on the Senses by Being Effects]]
+ [[The Attack on the Senses by Eddington's Two Tables]]

>We can know the content of reality "pure," apart from man's perceptual form; but [[The Objectivist Theory of the Formation of Concepts|we can do so only by abstracting away man's perceptual form]]—only by starting from sensory data, then performing a complex scientific process. To demand that the senses give us such "pure" content is to rewrite the function of the senses and the mind. It is to demand a blatant contradiction: a sensory image bearing no marks of its sensory character—or a *[[Percept|percept]]* of that which, by its nature, is the object only of a *[[Concept|concept]]*.[^1]
