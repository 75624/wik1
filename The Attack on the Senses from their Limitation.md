Various philosophers ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], #todo: add more examples as they come up, would be good to have at least 3), have throughout the course of history attacked the senses on the grounds that they are limited, concluding that they are therefore invalid. This, of course, ignores that:
1. [[The Validation of Sense Perception|the senses are valid]];
2. [[The Senses Do Not Distort|the senses don't distort]], and;
3. [[The Invalidity of the Senses Implies The Invalidity of Knowledge|if the senses are invalid then so is knowledge]], among other things.

What these theorists miss most importantly is that [[Omnipotence|everything that exists is limited]], what they seek is non-real sensory capabilities---supernatural capabilities for man. 

#todo: break this up into separate notes
>Those who condemn the senses as deceptive on the grounds that [[The Metaphysical Status of Sensory Qualities|sense qualities are merely effects on men]] are guilty of rewriting reality. Their viewpoint amounts to an ultimatum delivered to the universe: "I demand that the senses give me not effects, but irreducible primaries. That is how *I* would have [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|created reality]]." As in all cases of this fallacy, such a demand ignores the fact that what is [[Metaphysically Given|metaphysically given]] [[The Metaphysically Given as Absolute|is an absolute]]. [[Sense Perception|Perception]] is necessarily a process of interaction: there is no way to perceive an object that does not somehow impinge on one's body. Sense qualities, therefore, must be [[The Law of Causality|effects]]. To reject the senses for this reason is to reject them for existing—while yearning for a fantasy form of perception that in logic is not even thinkable.

>Those who condemn the senses on the grounds that sense qualities "are different from" the primaries that cause them (the "[[Two Tables|two tables]]" notion) are guilty of the same fallacy. They, too, demand that the primaries be given to man "pure," i.e., in no sensory form. The view of perception that underlies this kind of demand is the "mirror theory." The mirror theory holds that consciousness acts, or should act, as a luminous mirror (or diaphanous substance), reproducing external entities faithfully in its own inner world, untainted by any contribution from its organs of perception. This represents an attempt to rewrite the nature of consciousness. [[Consciousness]] is not a mirror or a transparent stuff or any kind of ethereal medium. It cannot be explicated by analogy to such physical objects; as we have seen, the concept is axiomatic and the faculty *sui generis*. Consciousness is not a faculty of reproduction, but of perception. Its function is not to create and then study an inner world that duplicates the outer world. Its function is directly to look outward, to perceive that which exists—and to do so by a certain means.

>As to the claim that the racing particles, [[A Physical Description of Entities does not Negate Their Existence|puffs]], or whatever that make up tables do not "look like" the peaceful brown things on which we eat in daily life, this is the literal reverse of the truth. "Looks" *means* "appears to our visual sense." The brown things are exactly what the puffs "look like." There are not "two tables." The brown things are a particular combination of the primary ingredients of reality; they are those ingredients as perceived by man.
