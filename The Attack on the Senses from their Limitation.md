Various philosophers ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], #todo: add more examples as they come up, would be good to have at least 3), have throughout the course of history attacked the senses on the grounds that they are limited, concluding that they are therefore invalid. This, of course, ignores that:
1. [[The Validation of Sense Perception|the senses are valid]];
2. [[The Senses Do Not Distort|the senses don't distort]], and;
3. [[The Invalidity of the Senses Implies The Invalidity of Knowledge|if the senses are invalid then so is knowledge]], among other things.

What these theorists miss most importantly is that [[Omnipotence|everything that exists is limited]], what they seek is non-real sensory capabilities---supernatural capabilities for man. 

>*Every* existent is bound by the laws of identity and causality. This applies not only to the physical world, but also to consciousness. [[Consciousness]]—any consciousness, of any species—is what it is. It is limited, finite, lawful. It is a faculty with a nature, which includes specific instrumentalities that enable it to achieve awareness. It is a *something* that has to grasp its objects *somehow*.[^1]

The assertion that consciousness (or anything else) is *limited* in it's capacities is just another way of saying that [[The Law of Identity|it is what it is]]---that it has specific properties as against possessing whatever random, contradictory, aspects. All of the standard, kitchen cabinet, attacks on the senses levied in the history of philosophy start in some way with the premise that an "ideal" consciousness would not be limited, that it would be able to grasp primaries directly, and that because consciousness is limited--because it has identity--it is therefore invalid. We are given a false-dichotomy: either you accept the premise that the ideal consciousness lacks identity, notice that our consciousness does not, and therefore conclude that our consciousness is invalid (such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]) **or** you accept the same premise that the ideal consciousness lacks identity, and conclude that our own consciousness must be a characterless "mirror," as do the [[Naive Realism|naïve realists]]---it is the [[Objectivism|Objectivists]] who recognise this as a [[Package Deal|package deal]] and drop the poison pill.

The following is a list of some influential instances of the fallacy of attacking the senses from being limited:
+ [[The Attack on the Senses by Being Effects]]
+ [[The Attack on the Senses by Eddington's Two Tables]]

>We can know the content of reality "pure," apart from man's perceptual form; but [[The Objectivist Theory of Concepts|we can do so only by abstracting away man's perceptual form]]---only by starting from sensory data, then performing a complex scientific process. To demand that the senses give us such "pure" content is to rewrite the function of the senses and the mind. It is to demand a blatant contradiction: a sensory image bearing no marks of its sensory character---or a *[[Percept|percept]]* of that which, by its nature, is the object only of a *[[Concept|concept]]*.[^2]
