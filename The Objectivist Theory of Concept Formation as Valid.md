There are five possible answers to the question of where [[Concept|concepts]] come from. Either:
1. there is a process that happens in the human mind to construct them from sensory data ([[Reason]]);
2. they exist in the human mind as [[Innate Ideas|innate ideas]];
3. there exists some other ([[Mysticism|mystic]]) means for acquiring new information (including concepts) completely independent of the senses;
4. concepts don't exist, or;
5. humans do not have epistemic access to concepts.

(1) is the pro-reason, [[Objectivism|Objectivist]] viewpoint. On [[The Objectivist Theory of Concepts|the Objectivist theory of concepts]], a concept is an integration of [[Percept|perceptual]] data, which rules out [[Innate Ideas|innate ideas]]:

>[[Consciousness]] begins as a *[[Tabula Rasa|tabula rasa]]* (a blank slate); all of its conceptual content is derived from the evidence of the senses.[^1]

Furthermore, [[Innate Knowledge as a Violation of Causality|innate knowledge violates the law of causality]], [[The Law of Causality|the law of causality]] is true, therefore innate knowledge cannot exist. This means that option (2) is false.

Option (3), is wrong because [[Mysticism as Invalid|mysticism is invalid]].

Options (4) and (5) both rely on language in their statement, language is itself conceptual, so they wipe themselves out.
