The error in conflating a [[Potential|potential]] with an [[Actual|actual]] is a common one. Examples include:
+ [[Zenos Paradox|Zeno's paradox]]---that man can infinitely divide the line is treated as meaning that the line is infinitely divided;
+ [[Cartesian Doubt|Cartesian doubt]]---that man can make an error is treated as meaning that he has made one;
+ #todo

The issue with this view is simply that the capacity of A to [[Metaphysical Action|act]] in some manner X under some set of circumstances Y, does not imply that A *is* doing X---[[The Law of Causality|every entity has only one action available to it at any given time]], so if the circumstances are not Y, then A would not necessarily be doing X. That an acorn has the potential to become a tree does not mean that the acorn *is* a tree; that a rock has the potential to fall down a hill does not mean that it *is* falling down a hill; and that a man has the potential to do wrong does not mean that man *is* wrong as such.
