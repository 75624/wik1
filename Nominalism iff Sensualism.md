[[Nominalism]] implies [[Sensualism|sensualism]], and sensualism implies nominalism.

On nominalism, [[Concept|universals]] are not real, they do not exist in reality. If there are no universals, only [[Particular|particulars]], then there is nothing for man to do cognitively than to [[Sense Perception|perceive]] these particulars. So all thought is sense perception. Therefore nominalism -> sensualism.

On sensualism, man only has the faculty of sense perception. Of course, you do not directly grasp universals through sense perception, so man could never come to discover any *real* universals. This leaves concepts as being mere arbitrary names for groupings of particulars. Therefore sensualism -> nominalism.

Since the time of [[Hobbes]], [[The Conflation of Empiricism and Nominalism-Sensualism|empiricism has been almost universally conflated with nominalism-sensualism]], [[The Epistemic Consequences of Nominalism-Sensualism|leading to disastrous consequences]].
