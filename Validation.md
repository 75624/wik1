"Validation" is a broader concept than "[[Proof|proof]]" that refers to any process of establishing an idea's relationship to [[Existence Exists|reality]], whether it be [[Deduction|deduction]], [[Induction|induction]], or perceptual self-evidence. [[Axioms as Irreducible Primaries|Axioms]] fall under this third category: they are validated by direct sense perception, and [[Axioms as Undeniable|they cannot be coherently denied]].
