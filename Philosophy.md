Philosophy is the science that defines and studies the broadest [[Abstraction|abstractions]] possible to serve as man's cognitive guide. Philosophy can be broken down into the study of [[Metaphysics|the basic nature of existence]] (metaphysics), [[Epistemology|the nature and means of mans knowledge]] (epistemology), [[Ethics|the proper values for man]] (ethics), and [[Aesthetics|the purpose and proper standard for the evaluation of art]] (aesthetics). 

There are two fundamental similarities that tie these four[^1] branches together, as is hinted at by the above definition. The first is the universality of their scope: they comprise the broadest [[Abstraction|abstractions]] that can be made---metaphysics studies *[[Existence Exists|existence]]* as such; epistemology studies *[[Knowledge|knowledge]]* as such; ethics studies *[[Value|value]]* as such; and aesthetics [[Art as a Concretisation of Philosophy|studies the concretisation of those other branches]]. 

The second is their necessity as guides to [[Human Action|human action]]: metaphysics does not study specifically the nature of electrons, or chemicals, or any other particular field, but existence *as such*---whenever you do anything you are in some way relying on a certain model of how the world works, what existence is, [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|whether it is subservient to your consciousness]], etc.; so you must take into account metaphysics at every waking moment. Epistemology isn't providing man with a guide on how to acquire knowledge about mathematics, it gives him a guide on the attainment of knowledge *as such*---[[Reason as Man's Basic Means of Survival|any man requires knowledge to survive]], only the mathematician needs the specific knowledge pertaining to mathematics; thus any man needs epistemology, but not necessarily mathematics. Ethics tells man what values are, the proper method for selecting values and by what standard---without this man is blind. Aesthetics tells man how to distil these vast abstractions into concrete form [[The Necessity of Art as a Guide|which is required to serve as a guide to action]].

[^1]: I do not consider [[Politics|politics]] to be a genuine branch of philosophy. See: [[Politics as an Instance of The Primacy of Consciousness]] and [[Law as a Subset of Ethics]]
