Philosophy is the science that studies [[Metaphysics|the basic nature of existence]] (metaphysics), [[Epistemology|the nature and means of mans knowledge]] (epistemology), [[Ethics|the proper values for man]] (ethics), and [[Aesthetics|the purpose and proper standard for the evaluation of art]] (aesthetics). The fundamental similarity that ties these four[^1] branches together, is that they comprise the broadest abstractions that can be made---metaphysics studies *[[Existence Exists|existence]]* as such; epistemology studies *[[Knowledge|knowledge]]* as such; ethics studies *[[Value|value]]* as such; and aesthetics [[Art as a Concretisation of Philosophy|studies the concretisation of those other branches]].

[^1]: I do not consider [[Politics|politics]] to be a genuine branch of philosophy. See: [[Politics as an Instance of The Primacy of Consciousness]] and [[Law as a Subset of Ethics]]
