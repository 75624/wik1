[[David Hume|Hume]]'s guillotine can be stated that it is impossible to deduce an *[[Ought Statement|ought]]* from an *[[Is Statement|is]]*---the implication being that no normative claims can be true. The issue with this view is that it wipes itself out---the Humean is asserting an [[Epistemic Norm|epistemic norm]] that you *should* only believe in certain types of claims:
>You should only believe in the existence of stuff you or someone trustworthy have experienced or that must exist in order to explain the stuff that we have experienced.[^1]

It is simply arbitrary to make an exception for that epistemic norm as being truthful whilst rejecting every other normative claim.
