>[[Materialism|Materialists]] [[Consciousness as Naturalistic|sometimes regard]] the concept of "[[Consciousness|consciousness]]" as unscientific on the grounds that it cannot be defined. This overlooks the fact that there cannot be an infinite regress of definitions. All definitions reduce ultimately to certain [[Axioms as Irreducible Primaries|primary concepts]], which can be specified only ostensively; axiomatic concepts necessarily belong to this category. The concept of "matter," by contrast, is not an axiomatic concept and does require a definition, which it does not yet have; it requires an analytical definition that will integrate the facts of energy, particle theory, and more. To provide such a definition is [[The Error in Treating Physics Questions as Philosophy Questions|not, however, the task of philosophy]], which makes no specialized study of matter, but of physics. As far as philosophic usage is concerned, "matter" denotes merely the objects of [[Extrospection|extrospection]] or, more precisely, that of which all such objects are made. In this usage, the concept of "matter," like that of "consciousness," can be specified only ostensively.[^1]
