Man is capable of directly [[Percept|perceiving]] and thus [[The Role of the Senses|validating the existence of]] a great deal of physical phenomena---he knows that cars exist, and that they [[The Law of Identity|have certain properties]] which [[The Law of Causality|cause]] them to have various colours and whatnot. But, it takes a great deal more [[Concept|conceptual]] [[Deduction|deduction]] for him to discover the properties of various [[Sub-Atomic|sub-atomic]] phenomena.[^1] On the other hand, if there were sub-atomic creatures with conceptual [[Consciousness|consciousnesses]], they could directly [[Induction|induce]] these facts about the Quantum realm, and would have a much harder time deducing facts about macro-scopic objects---the upshot being that [[Different Forms of Sense Perception does not Invalidate Sense Perception|having different forms of sense perception does not invalidate sense perception]].

[^1]: I do not use this in [[Phenomenal|the Kantian sense]].
