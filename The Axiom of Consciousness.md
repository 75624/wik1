The act of grasping the first [[The Fundamental Axioms of Metaphysics|axiom]] of philosophy, that [[Existence Exists|existence exists]], implies the second: that you exist possessing *[[Consciousness|consciousness]]*.[^1]

>[[Consciousness]] is not inherent in the fact of existence as such; a world without conscious organisms is possible. But consciousness *is* inherent in *your grasp* of existence. Inherent in saying "*There is something*—of which I am aware" is: "There is something—*of which I am aware*."[^2]

[[The Axiom of Consciousness|The fact of consciousness]] is and must be an irreducible primary--an inescapable fact--a fundamental starting point--in any act of cognition. No matter the particular subject matter that a man studies, it must be true that he is studying *something*, which means he is *studying* something. This is not, nor could it be, negated by any *explanation* of consciousness, contrary to what some think: that scientists uncover the physical mechanisms that underlie consciousness does not negate consciousness, and similarly that religious [[Mysticism|mystics]] uncover some spiritual "soul" driving conscious thought would also not negate consciousness. Ultimately both the [[Types of Mysticism|mystics of spirit and the mystics of muscle]] are still engaged in a *study* of something that exists---they are and must be conscious.

[^1]: The term "consciousness" should be taken here to mean the faculty of perceiving that which exists, which rules out the common notion of [[A Consciousness Conscious Only of Itself|a pure self-consciousness]].
