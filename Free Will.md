Volition refers to the ability to make a selection between two or more possible courses available under the given circumstances---the choice selected is determined by the free individual's decision, which could have been otherwise. For instance, if a man, A, makes a choice, X---we say that this was a *choice*--i.e. that it was *free*--if he could have chosen Â¬X.
