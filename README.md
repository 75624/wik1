My brain in Obsidian

## Contributing Guide
- This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.
- Add tags to the YAML frontmatter under the `tags` key. Each note must include tags. Author(s) can be specified under the `authors` key. 
- Keep notes *atomic*. This is analogous to the separation of concerns principle in computer science, but applied universally. Each note should describe one thing and one thing only, when you start describing multiple things break the topic into separate notes. A good rule of thumb on this is that if you find that you start needing to use section headings, you are probably going too far.
