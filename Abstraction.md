The process of abstraction refers to the ability of [[Conceptual Consciousness|conceptual]] beings to selectively focus upon different attributes of [[Sense Perception|perceived]] [[Entity|entities]], and to mentally group these attributes together, [[The Objectivist Theory of Concepts|thus allowing the formation of concepts]]. On the perceptual [[The Levels of Consciousness|level of awareness]] all that is provided is the entire object which has certain similarities and certain differences from other objects, which cannot be separated out without the power of abstraction.

The cognitive role of abstraction, therefore, cannot be easily under-stated. Abstraction allows man to group different [[Particular|concretes]] according to their similarities, no matter the differences between them---man can isolate these relevant aspects and thereby regard any given object not as a mere entity, but as a *[[Unit (Epistemology)|unit]]*. An animal may be able to recognise such similarities and differences between entities, but "it cannot do anything cognitively with the relationships it perceives. To its consciousness, the noting of similarities is a dead end. Man can do something: he makes such data the basis of a method of cognitive organization. The first step of the method is the mental isolation of a group of similars."[^1]
