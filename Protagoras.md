**Protagoras** (/prəʊˈtæɡəˌræs/; Greek: Πρωταγόρας; c. [[490 BC]] – c. [[420 BC]]) was a [[Pre-Socratic|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosopher and [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] theorist. He is numbered as one of the [[Sophistry|sophists]] by [[Plato]]. In his dialogue _[[Protagoras (Dialogue)|Protagoras]]_, Plato credits him with inventing the role of the professional sophist.

Protagoras also is believed to have created a major controversy during ancient times through his statement that, "[[Primacy of the Personal Consciousness|Man is the measure of all things]]," interpreted (possibly wrongly, since he disagreed) by Plato to mean that there is no objective truth; Protagoras seems to have meant that each person's own personal history, experiences and expectations, developed over their lifetime, determine their judgments, opinions, and statements regarding "truth" (which is the title of the book in which Protagoras made this statement). When a person makes a judgment about a certain thing—good or bad or beautiful or unjust—that person will differ from other people's judgments because their experience has been different.
