1. [[The Senses as Distorted Implies Non-Consciousness|If the senses distort then man is not conscious of reality]];
2. [[The Axiom of Consciousness|man is conscious of reality]];
3. therefore the senses do not distort.

Man's [[Sense Perception|sensory apparatus]] [[The Validation of Sense Perception|is valid]], and has no power to distort the data confronting it. Perception is perception *of existence*---the senses are physical faculties of perception that respond automatically to real [[The Law of Causality|causal]] phenomena.[^1]

>Sensory experience is a form of awareness produced by physical [[Entity|entities]] (the external stimuli) acting on physical instrumentalities (the sense organs), which respond automatically, as a link in a causally determined chain. Obeying inexorable natural laws, the organs transmit a message to the nervous system and the brain. Such organs have no power of choice, no power to invent, distort, or deceive. They do not respond to a zero, only to a something, something real, some existential object which acts on them.

>The senses do not interpret their own reactions; they do not [[The Law of Identity|identify]] the objects that impinge on them. They merely respond to stimuli, thereby making us aware of the fact that some kind of objects exist. We do not become aware of what the objects are, but merely *that* they are. 'The task of \[man's], senses," writes [[Ayn Rand]], "is to give him the evidence of existence, but the task of identifying it belongs to his reason, his senses tell him only that something *is*, but *what* it is must be learned by his mind." It is only in regard to the "what"—only on the [[Concept|conceptual]] level of [[Consciousness|consciousness]]—that the possibility of error arises. If a boy sees a jolly bearded man in a red suit and infers that Santa Claus has come down from the North Pole, his senses have made no error; it is his conclusion that is mistaken.[^2]
