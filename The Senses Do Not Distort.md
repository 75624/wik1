1. [[The Senses as Distorted Implies Non-Consciousness|If the senses distort then man is not conscious of reality]];
2. [[The Axiom of Consciousness|man is conscious of reality]];
3. therefore the senses do not distort.

Man's [[Sense Perception|sensory apparatus]] [[The Validation of Sense Perception|is valid]], and has no power to distort the data confronting it. Perception is perception *of existence*---the senses are physical faculties of perception that respond automatically to real [[The Law of Causality|causal]] phenomena.[^1]

>Sensory experience is a form of awareness produced by physical [[Entity|entities]] (the external stimuli) acting on physical instrumentalities (the sense organs), which respond automatically, as a link in a causally determined chain. Obeying inexorable natural laws, the organs transmit a message to the nervous system and the brain. Such organs have no power of choice, no power to invent, distort, or deceive. They do not respond to a zero, only to a something, something real, some existential object which acts on them.[^2]
