In [[Metaphysics|metaphysics]], *entities* are those constituents of the world---they are the *[[The Law of Identity|things]]* that [[Existence Exists|exist]]. Entity is an [[Axioms as Irreducible Primaries|axiomatic]] [[Concept|concept]], it is therefore not subject to any definition beyond an *ostensive* one, that is by pointing to examples:

>In this case, one points to solid things with a perceivable shape, such as a rock, a person, or a table. By extension from this primary sense, “entity” may be used in various contexts to denote a vast array of existents, such as the solar system, General Motors, or the smallest subatomic particle. But all “entities” like these are reducible ultimately to combinations, components, or distinguishable aspects of “entities” in the primary sense.[^1]
