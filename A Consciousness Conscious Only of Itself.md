The notion of a consciousness conscious only of itself is a common form of [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|the fallacy of the primacy of consciousness]]. It can be easily attacked on those grounds but simply more straight-forwardly it is a contradiction in terms: 

>If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothing to be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itself as consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claim to perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness.[^1]

This specific form of the primacy of consciousness is seen in [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[Aristotle's Unmoved Mover|unmoved mover]].
