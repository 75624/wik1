Omnipotence means unlimited ability---in precise terms it is the ability of an [[Entity|entity]] to act outside of its [[The Law of Identity|nature]]. This is a violation of [[The Law of Causality|the law of causality]]: every entity has one and only one action available to it, namely the action caused by its nature. Specifically, omnipotence is a subset of super-nature: an omnipotent entity is one that can do *anything*, a supernatural one is one that can do *at least one* thing outside of its nature.

>"Supernatural," etymologically, means that which is above or beyond nature. "Nature," in turn, denotes existence viewed from a certain perspective. Nature is existence regarded as a system of interconnected entities governed by law; it is the universe of entities acting and interacting in accordance with their identities. What then is a "super-nature"? It would have to be a form of existence beyond existence; a thing beyond entities; a something beyond identity.[^1]
