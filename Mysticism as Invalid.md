1. Mysticism relies on the premise that consciousness has metaphysical primacy
2. [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|consciousness does not have metaphysical primacy]]
3. mysticism is false

[[Mysticism]] refers to any [[Epistemology|epistemology]] which holds that it is possible to obtain [[Knowledge|knowledge]] apart from [[Sensation|the senses]]. At its root, mysticism is an example of [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|the primacy of consciousness]]---to verify simply consider how it is that the mystic claims to know whether his intuitions are correct or not. He is certainly not verifying them by reference to some existent as one might verify the sky to be blue by pointing at it---the mystic knows without the senses, so this is out. He is also not verifying any claims with [[Logic|logic]]---logic is the art of non-contradictory identification, it is the method of [[Reason|reason]] and is based at its core on reference to [[Percept|perceptual]] data. Rather, the mystic attempts to [[Validation|validate]] his conclusions based upon ineffable [[Emotions|feelings]]---in short, the mystic takes the stance "I think this is true because I feel like it is."

This is simply an absurd notion---feelings are not [[Omnipotence|supernatural]] conduits to reality, they are the product of one's past thinking and ideas. To say that you feel a certain way means only that in the past you had certain thoughts which then imply the emotion at hand---this does not show that said thoughts from which the feeling arises are indeed accurate. You require a method of validating *those thoughts*---this method is the method of reason.

The stance that thinking something is true actually makes it true relies on the prior [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] premise that your thoughts are the basis of reality and the standard of truth---that [[Consciousness|consciousness]] is the fountainhead of reality---that [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|consciousness has metaphysical primacy]].
