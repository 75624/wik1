>The [[Validation|validity]] of [[Sense Perception|the senses]] is an [[Axioms as Irreducible Primaries|axiom]]. Like [[The Axiom of Consciousness|the fact of consciousness]], the axiom is outside the province of [[Proof|proof]] because it is a precondition of any proof.
>
>Proof consists in reducing an idea back to [[Percept|the data provided by the senses]]. These data themselves, the foundation of all subsequent [[Knowledge|knowledge]], precede any process of inference. They are the primaries of cognition, the unchallengeable, the *self-evident*.[^1]

The validity of sense perception is a [[Corollary|corollary]] of [[The Axiom of Consciousness|the axiom of consciousness]]: 
> If man is [[Consciousness|conscious]] of that which is, then his *means* of awareness are means of *awareness*, i.e., are valid. One cannot affirm consciousness while denying its primary form, [[Mysticism as Invalid|which makes all the others possible]]. Just as any attack on consciousness negates itself, so does any attack on the senses. [[The Invalidity of the Senses Implies The Invalidity of Knowledge|If the senses are not valid, neither are any concepts]], including the ones used in the attack.[^2]
