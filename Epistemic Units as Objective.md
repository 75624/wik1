A [[Unit (Epistemology)|unit]] is "an existent regarded as a separate member of a group of two or more similar members."[^1] Units do not exist "out there," that is, apart from man. The unit is a product of a [[Conceptual Consciousness|conceptual consciousness]]. In the realm of nature there are only completely separate [[Entity|entities]] acting according to their [[The Law of Identity|nature]] with their own specific properties---there is only "Bob," "Jill," "the Queen of England," etc., not "Man." 

This means that to speak of *units* is to speak from a specifically human--or conceptual--perspective---but this does not imply [[Subjective|subjectivism]]:

>\[...] the concept "unit" involves an act of [[Consciousness|consciousness]] (a selective [[Mental Focus|focus]], a certain way of regarding things), but \[...] it is not an arbitrary creation of consciousness: it is a method of identification or classification according to the attributes which a consciousness observes in reality. This method permits any number of classifications and cross-classifications: one may classify things according to their shape or color or weight or size or atomic structure; but the criterion of classification is not invented, it is perceived in reality. Thus the concept "unit" is a bridge between [[Metaphysics|metaphysics]] and [[Epistemology|epistemology]]: units do not exist qua units, what exists are things, but units are things viewed by a consciousness in certain existing relationships.[^2]
