*Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand*, Meridian ([[1991]])

>Although [[Ayn Rand]] defined a full philosophic system, which she called [[Objectivism]] Objectivism, she never wrote a comprehensive, nonfiction presentation of it. Rand’s interest in philosophy stemmed originally from her desire to create heroic fictional characters for her novels, especially *[[AS|Atlas Shrugged]]*, whose final philosophic speech she called Objectivism’s “briefest summary.”
>
>In 1976, philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]], her longtime student and associate, gave a lecture course that Rand described as “the only authorized presentation of the entire theoretical structure of Objectivism, i.e., the only one that I know of my own knowledge to be fully accurate.”
>
>Following Rand’s death, Peikoff edited and reorganized those lectures to produce _Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand_, the first comprehensive statement of her philosophy. Published in 1991, this book presents Rand’s entire philosophy—[[Metaphysics|metaphysics]], [[Epistemology|epistemology]], [[Ethics|ethics]], [[Politics|politics]] and [[Aesthetics|esthetics]]—in essentialized and systematic form.[^1]
