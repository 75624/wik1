**Plato** (/ˈpleɪtoʊ/ _PLAY-toe_; Greek: Πλάτων _Plátōn_; [[428 BC|428]]/[[427 BC|427]] or [[424 BC|424]]/[[423 BC|423]] – [[348 BC]]) was an ancient Greek philosopher born in Athens during the Classical period in Ancient Greece.

In Athens, Plato founded the [[Platonic Academy]], a philosophical school where he taught the philosophical doctrines that would later become known as [[Platonism]]. Plato, or Platon, was a pen name derived, apparently, from the nickname given to him by his wrestling coach---allegedly a reference to his physical broadness. According to [[Alexander Polyhistor]], quoted by [[Diogenes]], his actual name was **Aristocles**, son of Ariston, of the deme (suburb) Collytus, in Athens.
