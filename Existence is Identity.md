>Ayn Rand offers a new formulation of \[[[The Law of Identity|the law of identity]]\]: [[Existence Exists|existence]] *is* identity. She does not say "existence *has* identity"â€”which might suggest that identity is a feature separable from existence (as a coat of paint is separable from the house that has it). The point is that to be is to be something. Existence and identity are indivisible; either implies the other. If something *exists*, then *something* exists; and if there is a *something*, then there *is* a something. The fundamental fact cannot be broken in two.[^1]
