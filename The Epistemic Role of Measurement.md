>The [[Epistemology|epistemological]] purpose of [[Measurement|measurement]] is best approached through an example. Consider the fact that the distance between the earth and the moon is 240,000 miles. No creature can perceive so vast a distance; to an animal, accordingly, it is unknowable and unfathomable. Yet man has no difficulty in grasping (and now even traversing) it. What makes this cognitive feat possible is the human method of establishing relationships to concretes we *can* directly perceive. We cannot perceive 240,000 miles, but that distance is expressed in miles, and a mile is reducible to a certain number of feet, and a foot is: *this* (I am pointing to a ruler). It works in the other direction also. A certain chemical reaction, a scientist reports, takes place in 4.6 milliseconds. A thousandth of a second is too small to be within the range of perceptual awareness. Yet by relating this time interval, as a fraction, to one that we can apprehend directly, we can grasp and deal with it as well. In both directions, [[Ayn Rand]] holds, and in regard to countless attributes, the

>>The process of measurement is a process of integrating an unlimited scale of knowledge to man's limited perceptual experienceâ€”a process of making the universe knowable by bringing it within the range of man's consciousness, by establishing its relationship to man.[^1]
