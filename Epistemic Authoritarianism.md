Authoritarianism is the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] position that knowledge derives from appeals to relevant authorities. A typical authoritarian would not forward his viewpoint by demonstrating its correspondence to reality, or providing arguments as to its [[Validation|validity]], but rather by saying something like "[[Plato]] agreed with this," or "these [[The Church Fathers|Church fathers]] agreed with this."

This represents a form of [[Mysticism|mysticism]] and is invalid on [[Mysticism as Invalid|on the same grounds]]---that some priest or sage or [[Scientism|scientist]] advanced a given viewpoint does not demonstrate the viewpoint to be correct. "Plato said so" simply is not an argument---it is to be discarded as irrelevant for the evaluation of the truth value of the proposition in question.
