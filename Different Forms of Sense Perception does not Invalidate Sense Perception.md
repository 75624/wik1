[[The Senses Do Not Distort|The senses don't distort]], and this is not invalidated by the fact that different creatures have different forms of sense perception. A color-blind man is able to deduce the same laws of physics as one with a greater ability to distinguish between hues (note that no human is able to distinguish between radio- and infrared-rays of light using his eyes, and yet we know of their existence)---[[Epistemology as Dependent Upon the Fallibility of a Conceptual Consciousness|assuming no errors are made]]. Even a totally blind man could deduce that other men are capable of seeing by various tests, he could [[Validation|validate]] that they are able to figure out what objects are without coming into physical contact---the same is true for Martians, who share no senses with us, they would still be able to deduce the *same* laws of physics. A caveat to this is that [[Different Forms of Sense Perception Lead to Different Capabilities in Deducing Laws|different forms of sense perception lead to different capabilities in deducing laws]].

>[[Ayn Rand]] observes \[...] that a difference in [[Sense Perception|sensory form]] among perceivers is precisely that: it is a difference in the *form* of perceiving the same objects, the same one [[Existence Exists|reality]]. Such a difference does not pertain to cognitive content and does not indicate any disagreement among the parties. The senses of a man with normal vision, to take the standard example, do not contradict those of a color-blind man. When the former says about some object, "It is red," he must in reason mean by the statement: "It is an entity in reality of a specific nature such that, when it acts on *my* senses, I perceive it in the form of red color." That is true; that is what it is. Similarly, if the color-blind man says "It is gray," he has to mean: "It is an entity in reality of a specific nature such that, when it acts on *my* senses, I perceive it in the form of gray color." That also is true; that is what it is. Neither statement conflicts with the other. Both men are perceiving that which is and are doing so in a specific form.

>Nor will these two men or any other perceiver with an intellect come to different conclusions about the nature of the object. In this respect, *differences in sensory form do not matter*. They have no consequences in regard to the content of cognition.[^1]
