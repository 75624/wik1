The [[The Primary Choice Being Focus or Drift|primary choice]] available to man is to either focus or drift. Because this is the *primary* it cannot be motivated by any [[Ethical Value|value]] judgements whatsoever. For a value judgement, or a purpose, or whatever other term you wish to use must come *after* there has already been choice. On the secondary level, however, that of the choice between [[Thought|thought]] and [[Evasion|evasion]], this choice [[The Secondary Choice as Being Motivated|is indeed motivated]]. This choice is secondary because [[Focus as Antecedent to Any Choice|focus is the logical antecedent of any other choice]], it involves the decision of whether to integrate ([[Thought|thought]]) or disintegrate ([[Evasion|evasion]]) the [[Percept|percepts]] that one is faced with.
