This is the individualistic version of the [[Primacy of the Social Consciousness|primacy of the social consciousness]], formulated prominently by [[Protagoras]] as: "Man" being "the measure of all things." On this view, each man inhabits his own universe created by his own mind---there is only private reality, not reality for all.

> [[Epistemology|Epistemologically]], therefore, there are no standards or data of any kind to which a person must conform. There is only truth "for me" vs. truth "for you"---which truth is, for any individual, whatever he arbitrarily decrees it to be.[^1]
