Sensation is the lowest [[The Levels of Consciousness|level]] of [[Consciousness|consciousness]], in the words of [[Leonard Peikoff|Peikoff]], sensations are "irreducible state\[s] of awareness [[The Law of Causality|produced by]] the [[Metaphysical Action|action]] of a stimulus on a [[The Senses|sense organ]]."[^1] "Irreducible" because a sensation cannot be broken down into simpler conscious units---there are not turtles all the way down, sensations are the root of all awareness. "Produced by" because sensations [[The Attack on the Senses from their Limitation|are not primaries]]---under a certain set of circumstances a sense organ will cause certain effects. For instance, when a ray of light hits the retina of your eye, the relevant cells will inexorably send a signal to your brain representing some colour; similarly, when sound waves vibrate your ear drum there is a sensation of sound at a certain pitch. What this means is that there is no choice involved on the sensory level---you cannot control the operation of your sense organs, [[The Validation of Free Will|unlike your conceptual faculty]].

Another important point, implicit in the above, is that a sensation lasts only as long as the sensory stimulus is maintained---your eye ball will stop sending colour signals the instant the light is no longer entering it. To do otherwise would mean to have an effect without a cause---which is a violation of [[The Law of Causality|the law of causality]].
