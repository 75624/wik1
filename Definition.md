A definition is a statement that identifies the [[The Law of Identity|nature]] of a [[Concept|concept's]] [[Unit (Epistemology)|units]].[^1] [[The Role of Definition for a Conceptual Being|Definition is the final stage of concept-formation]].

> A proper definition is made of two parts, each of which follows from the nature of [[The Objectivist Theory of Concepts|concept-formation]]. When we form a [[Concept|concept]], we isolate its [[Unit (Epistemology)|units]] by grasping a [[Differentiation|distinguishing]] characteristic. In the definition, this becomes what the medieval Aristotelians called the *differentia*. Further, we can differentiate only on the basis of a wider characteristic, the [[Conceptual Common Denominator|CCD]], which is shared both by the [[Particular|concretes]] we are isolating and by the concretes from which we are isolating them. In the definition, this gives rise to the *genus*.

> A definition in terms of genus and differentia is like a logical X ray of a concept. It condenses into a brief, retainable statement the essence of the concept-forming process: it tells us what distinguishes the units and from what they are being distinguished, i.e., within what wider group the distinction is being made. To give the standard example: if we conceptualize man by differentiating men from dogs, cats, and horses, then "animal" would be the genus---"rational," the differentia.[^2]
