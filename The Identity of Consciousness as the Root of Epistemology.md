The standard [[The Attack on the Senses from their Limitation|attacks on man's consciousness by it's identity]] all undercut [[Epistemology|epistemology]] at its foundation---that consciousness has identity, that it [[The Law of Identity|is what it is]], is the fundamental principle from which the rest of epistemology springs.

>Every process of knowledge involves two crucial elements: the object of cognition and the means of cognition---or: *What* do I know? and *How* do I know it? The object (which is studied by the special sciences) is always some aspect of reality; there is nothing else to know. The means (which is studied by epistemology) pertains to the kind of consciousness and determines the form of cognition.

>The start of a proper epistemology lies in recognizing that there can be no conflict between these elements.

>Contrary to the [[Scepticism|skeptics]] of history, the fact of a means cannot be used to deny that the object of cognition is reality. Contrary to the [[Mysticism|mystics]], the fact that the object is reality cannot be used to deny that we know it by a specific, human means.

>The "how" cannot be used to negate the "what," or the "what" the "how"â€”not if one understands that A is A and that consciousness is consciousness.[^1]
