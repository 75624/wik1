God is said to be purely spiritual, but a [[A Consciousness Conscious Only of Itself|pure self-consciousness]] is ruled out by the argument against [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|the primacy of consciousness]].

>Is God purely spiritual? "Spiritual" means [[Subjective|pertaining to consciousness]], and [[Consciousness|consciousness]] is a faculty of certain living organisms, their faculty of perceiving that which exists. A consciousness transcending nature would be a faculty transcending organism and object. So far from being [[Omniscience|all-knowing]], such a thing would have neither means nor content of perception; it would be nonconscious.
