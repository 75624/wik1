>In regard to [[Epistemology|epistemology]], [[Ayn Rand]] describes the [[Idealism|idealists]] as [[Mysticism|mystics]], "mystics of spirit." They are mystics because they hold that [[Knowledge|knowledge]] (of true reality) derives not from [[Sense Perception|sense perception]] or from [[Reason|reasoning]] based on it, but from an otherworldly source, such as revelations or the equivalent. The more sophisticated versions of idealism rest on technical analyses of the nature of [[Percept|percepts]] or [[Concept|concepts]]; ***these analyses will be considered in later chapters*** #todo. The unsophisticated but popular version of idealism, which typically upholds a personalized other dimension, is [[Religion|religion]]. Essential to all versions of the creed, however—and to countless kindred movements—is the belief in the *[[Omnipotence|supernatural]]*.[^1]
