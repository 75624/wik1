>The facts \[...] belie any equation of [[Consciousness|consciousness]] with [[Mysticism|mysticism]]. Consciousness is an attribute of perceived [[Entity|entities]] here on earth. It is a faculty possessed under definite conditions by a certain group of living organisms. It is directly observable (by introspection). It has a specific [[The Law of Identity|nature]], including specific physical organs, and [[The Law of Causality|acts accordingly]], i.e., lawfully. It has a life-sustaining function: to [[Sense Perception|perceive]] the facts of nature and thereby enable the organisms that possess it to [[Human Action|act]] successfully. In all this, there is nothing unnatural or [[Omnipotence|supernatural]]. There is no basis for [[The Materialist-Idealist False Dichotomy|the suggestion that consciousness is separable from matter]], let alone opposed to it, no hint of [[Immorrtality|immortality]], no kinship to any alleged transcendent realm.

>Materialists sometimes argue that consciousness is unnatural on the grounds that it cannot be [[Sense Perception|perceived]] by [[Extrospection|extrospection]], has no shape, color, or smell, and cannot be handled, weighed, or put in a test tube (all of which applies equally to the faculty of vision). One may just as well argue that the eyeball is unreal because it cannot be perceived by [[Introspection|introspection]], does not have the qualities of a process of awareness (such as intensity or scope of integration), and cannot theorize about itself, suffer neurotic problems, or fall in love. These two arguments are interchangeable. It makes no more sense [[The Materialist-Idealist False Dichotomy|arbitrarily to legislate features of matter as the standard of existents and then deny consciousness, than to do the reverse]]. The facts are that [[Existence Exists|matter exists]] and so does [[The Axiom of Consciousness|consciousness]], the faculty of perceiving it.[^1]
