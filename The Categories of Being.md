Various philosophers have attempted to identify and list so-called "categories" of being, such as qualities ("red" or "hard"), quantities ("five inches" or "six pounds"), relationships ("to the right of" or "father of"), [[Metaphysical Action|actions]] ("walking" or "digesting"), etc.[^1] The mistake these philosophers make in this task is to assert that some selection of these categories has metaphysical primacy (see also: [[The Primary-Secondary Quality Distinction]]). The reason this view is in error is because none of these "categories" has any independent existence; they all merely represent aspects of [[Entity|entities]]:

>There is no "red" or "hard" apart from the crayon or book or other thing that is red or hard. "Five inches" or "six pounds" presuppose the object that extends five inches or weighs six pounds. "To the right of" or "father of" have no reality apart from the things one of which is to the right of another or is the father of another. And--especially important in considering the law of cause and effect--**there are no floating actions; there are only actions performed by entities. "Action" is the name for what entities do. "Walking" or "digesting" have no existence or possibility apart from the creature with legs that walks or the body or organ with enzymes that does the digesting.**[^2]
