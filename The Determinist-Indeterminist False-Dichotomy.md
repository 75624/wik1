The [[Determinism|determinist]] thesis is that there is no such thing as [[Free Will|volition]]. On this point they present us a dichotomy: either you accept [[The Law of Causality|causality]] in which case every [[Metaphysical Action|action]] of man is caused and therefore pre-determined, or you reject causality in order to keep volition in the picture. This is a false-dichotomy accepted by the "indeterminists," who accept this notion of [[Libertarian Free Will|libertarian free-will]]---that is, they agree with the fundamental premise that causality is incompatible with free-will, then accept that man does have free will, and therefore conclude that causality is false.

The origin of this dichotomy is found in [[The Error of Mechanistic Causality|the erroneous notion of "mechanistic causality,"]] to put it clearly: to be caused does *not* mean to be [[The Metaphysically Given as Absolute|necessary]]. All that the law of cause and effect tells us is that every action has a cause and that the same cause has the same effect; it does not say that said action cannot be *to choose*. Specifically, the [[Metaphysical Action|action]] caused by man's nature is to *select* or *choose* between different possible activities---this is still an action caused by his nature, it is not a non-action, nor is it man acting outside of or against his nature.

It is on this that the only valid conception of "compatibilism" is found: namely, compatibilism is correct if it is the thesis that causality is compatible with free will, but not if it is the thesis that determinism is compatible with free will.

To be clear: man's choices are indeed caused, caused by his specific [[The Law of Identity|nature]] as a [[Conceptual Consciousness|conceptual being]]. It is a specific trait of a conceptual consciousness in particular that it has the faculty of [[Reason|reason]] [[The Validation of Free Will|which is not and cannot be pre-determined]]. This can be [[Validation|validated]] not only on the grounds of [[Epistemology as Dependent Upon the Fallibility of a Conceptual Consciousness|epistemology being dependent upon the fallibility of a conceptual consciousness]], or on [[The Validation of Free Will|the impossibility of the determinist validating his own thesis on his own grounds]], but also by direct [[Introspection|introspection]]. All honest men can grasp the fact that they can [[Mental Focus|focus]] their mind to [[Mental Focus as Having Degrees|differing degrees]] and that said focus can be employed either in [[Evasion|blanking out]] or [[Thought|seriously apprehending]] reality.

>[[Objectivism]] regards this dilemma as a false alternative. Man's actions do have causes; he does choose a course of behavior for a reasonâ€”but this does not make the course determined or the choice unreal. It does not, because man himself decides what are to be the governing reasons. *Man chooses the causes that shape his actions*.

>To say that a higher-level choice was caused is to say: there was a reason behind it, but other reasons were possible under the circumstances, and the individual himself made the selection among them.[^1]
