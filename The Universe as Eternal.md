A common error related to [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|the primacy of consciousness]] is the assumption that the universe requires a cause. It is asked "what caused existence to exist?" and other such nonsense. Recall that [[The Law of Causality|the law of causality]] does not state that every entity has a cause, rather it states that every *action* has a cause and that [[The Categories of Being|all action is action of entities]].

The universe simply *is*; it is an [[Axioms as Irreducible Primaries|irreducible primary]]. An entity may be said to have a cause only if it is the kind of entity that is noneternal; and then what one actually explains causally is a process, the fact of its coming into being or another thing's passing away. Action is the crux of the law of cause and effect: it is action that is caused---by [[Entity|entities]].
