**Aristotle** (/ˈærɪstɒtəl/; Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης _Aristotélēs_, pronounced \[aristotélɛːs]; [[384 BC|384]]–[[322 BC]]) was an Ancient Greek [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and polymath. His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the [[The Natural Sciences|natural sciences]], [[Philosophy|philosophy]], [[Linguistics|linguistics]], [[Economics|economics]], [[Politics|politics]], [[Psychology|psychology]] and [[Aesthetics|the arts]]. As the founder of the [[The Peripatetic School|Peripatetic school]] of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens, he began the wider [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern science.

Little is known about Aristotle's life. He was born in the city of Stagira in northern Greece during the [[Greek Classical Period|Classical period]]. His father, [[Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At 17 or 18 he joined [[Plato]]'s [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in Athens and remained there till the age of 37 (c. [[347 BC]]). Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip II of Macedon]], tutored his son [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander the Great]] beginning in [[343 BC]]. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls.
