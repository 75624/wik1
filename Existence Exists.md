That existence[^1] exists is the most fundamental [[Axioms as Irreducible Primaries|axiom]] in all of philosophy, and any deviation from having this at the root [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|leads to utter disaster]].

>We begin as philosophers where we began as babies, at the only place there is to begin: by looking at the world.[^2]

The very first thing a man might say about what there is is simply that it *is*: what is, is; existence exists. 

>This axiom must be the foundation of everything else. Before one can consider any other issue, before one can ask what things there are or what problems men face in learning about them, before one can discuss what one knows or how one knows it---first, there must *be* something, and one must grasp that there is. If not, there is nothing to consider or to know.[^3]
