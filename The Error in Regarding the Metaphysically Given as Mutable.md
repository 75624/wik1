The error in regarding the [[Metaphysically Given|metaphysically given]] doesn't merely amount to an [[Evasion|evasion]] of reality (as is the case with [[The Error in Regarding the Man-Made as Immutable|regarding the man-made as immutable]]), but rather to declaring an all-out war on reality.

>The attempt to alter the metaphysically given is described by [[Ayn Rand]] as the fallacy of "rewriting reality." Those who commit it regard metaphysically given facts as nonabsolute and, therefore, [[The Metaphysically Given as Absolute|feel free to imagine an alternative]] to them. In effect, they regard the universe as being merely a first draft of reality, which anyone may decide at will to rewrite.

>A common example is provided by those who condemn life because man is capable of failure, frustration, pain, and who yearn instead for a world in which man knows nothing but happiness. But if the possibility of failure exists, it *[[The Metaphysically Given as Absolute|necessarily]]* exists (it is inherent in the facts that achieving a [[Ethical Value|value]] requires a specific course of action, and that man is neither [[Omniscience|omniscient]] nor [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] in regard to such action). Anyone who holds the full context—who keeps in mind the *[[The Law of Identity|identity]]* of man and of all the other relevant [[Entity|entities]]—would be unable even to imagine an alternative to the facts as they are; the contradictions involved in such a projection would obliterate it. The rewriters, however, do not keep identity in mind. They specialize in out-of-context pining for a heaven that is the opposite of the metaphysically given.[^1]

Another example of this error present in [[Epistemology|epistemology]], is seen in those [[Scepticism|sceptics]] who attempt to [[Validation|invalidate]]
