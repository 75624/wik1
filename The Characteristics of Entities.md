Whilst [[Entity|entities]] are fundamentally ostensive, we can still say that an entity has these characteristics:
1. an entity is a self-sufficient [[Existence Exists|existent]], as against a quality, action, relationship, etc., which are aspects of some entity or entities which man separates out by a specialised focus---an entity is a *thing*; *this*, *you*, *it*; as against *hot*, *cold*, *running*, *jumping*, *to the left of*, etc.;
2. an entity is [[Percept|perceptual]] in scale---it is a solid thing that you can perceive and point to.
