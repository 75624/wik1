The "conceptual common denominator" (CCD) is what allows for [[Abstraction|abstract differentiation]] to occur. In the words of [[Ayn Rand]], the CCD is:

>The characteristic(s) reducible to a unit of [[Measurement|measurement]], by means of which man [[Differentiation|differentiates]] two or more existents from other existents possessing it.[^1]

So, we can reduce the shape of a table down to a unit of measurement, namely feet, and radians, etc.---we *define* the shape of a specific table with reference to the concepts of length, and angle. We then differentiate *this* "table-ey" shape from other shapes, and thus we can form the concept "table"---we do not differentiate the shape of a table from objects that are red, because shape and colour are *[[Commensurability|incommensurable]]*. [[Leonard Peikoff|Peikoff]] elaborates:

>\[...] one can differentiate tables from chairs or beds, because all these groups possess a commensurable characteristic, shape. This CCD, in turn, determines what feature must be chosen as the distinguishing characteristic of the concept "table": tables are distinguished by a specific *kind* of shape, which represents a specific category or set of geometric [[Measurement|measurements]] within the characteristic of shape---as against beds, e.g., whose shapes are encompassed by a different set of measurements. ([[The Metaphysical Status of Concepts|Once the appropriate category has been specified, one completes the process of forming "table" by omitting the measurements of the individual table shapes within that category.]])[^2]
