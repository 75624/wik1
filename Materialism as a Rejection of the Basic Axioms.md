>[[Materialism|Materialists]]—men such as [[Democritus]], [[Hobbes]], [[Marx]], [[Skinner]]—champion nature but deny the reality or efficacy of [[Consciousness|consciousness]]. Consciousness, in this view, is either a myth or a useless byproduct of brain or other motions. In [[Objectivism|Objectivist]] terms, this amounts to the advocacy of [[Existence Exists|existence]] without consciousness. It is the denial of man's faculty of cognition and [[Innate Knowledge as a Violation of Causality|therefore]] of all [[Knowledge|knowledge]].

>[[Ayn Rand]] describes materialists as "[[Mystics of Muscle|mystics of muscle]]"—"[[Mysticism|mystics]]" because, like [[Idealism|idealists]], they reject the faculty of [[Reason|reason]]. Man, they hold, is essentially a body without a mind. His conclusions, accordingly, reflect not the [[The Meaning of Objectivity|objective]] methodology of reason and [[Logic|logic]], but the blind operation of physical factors, such as atomic dances in the cerebrum, glandular squirtings, S-R conditioning, or the tools of production moving in that weird, waltzlike contortion known as the dialectic process.[^1]
