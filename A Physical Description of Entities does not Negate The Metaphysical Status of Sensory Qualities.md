[[The Metaphysical Status of Sensory Qualities|The metaphysical status of sensory qualities]] has it that a [[Sense Perception|sensation]] is an interaction between two [[Entity|entities]], namely the organ of sense perception and the [[The Law of Identity|thing]] that is being perceived. [[Leonard Peikoff|Peikoff]] highlights that this is true even if [[A Physical Description of Entities is the Realm of Physics, not Philosophy|a physical description of entities is found]] by supposing that [[Physics|physicists]] one day reduce every physical phenomenon down to "puffs of meta-energy:"
>If everything is made of meta-energy puffs, then so are human beings and their parts, including their sense organs, nervous system, and brain. The process of sense perception, by this account, would involve a certain relationship among the puffs: it would consist of an interaction between those that comprise external entities and those that comprise the perceptual apparatus and brain of human beings. The result of this interaction would be the material world as we perceive it, with all of its objects and their qualities, from men to mosquitoes to stars to feathers.

>Even under the present hypothesis, such objects and qualities [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|would not be products of consciousness]]. Their [[Existence Exists|existence]] would be a *[[Metaphysically Given|metaphysically given]] fact*; it would be a consequence of certain puff-interactions that is outside of man's power to create or destroy. The things we perceive, in this theory, would not be primaries, but they would nevertheless be unimpeachably real.[^1]
