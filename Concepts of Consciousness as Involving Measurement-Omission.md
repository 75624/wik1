[[The Objectivist Theory of Concepts|The process of concept-formation]] [[The Metaphysical Status of Concepts|involves bearing in mind the attributes but omitting the measurements]] of observed existents. This is true for all [[Concept|concepts]], of [[Conceptual Order|every order]], including those pertaining to [[Consciousness|consciousness]]. The key insight to recognise that this is true for concepts of consciousness "lies in the fact that every process of consciousness involves two fundamental attributes: [[Conscious Content|content]] and [[Conscious Action|action]]."[^1]

Let's take as an example--to follow [[Leonard Peikoff]]--the concept of "[[Thought|thought]]." First, thought is thought *about something*--there is some particular *content* of the thought--but when we speak of the concept "thought" we are not concerned about the specific content of that thought. There will be certain [[Measurement|measurements]] which distinguish *this* specific content from *that* specific content---and these are omitted; all that matters is that there is *some* content but that it can be *any* content.

Second, the thought about $x$[^2] will exist with a certain [[Psychological Intensity|intensity]]---the content will be broad or narrow; it will have a given [[Mental Focus as Having Degrees|clarity]]; it will exist within a certain context; etc. Notice the [[Quantitative|quantitative]] language used here---we speak of the scope of the thought being *broad* as against *narrow*; of the thought being with a certain *degree* of clarity; etc. In general the *intensity* of a thought process also exists with certain measurements---these measurements are then omitted; all that matters is that there is *some* intensity to the mental action, but it can have *any* intensity.

[[Ayn Rand]] states the point as follows:

>A concept pertaining to consciousness is a mental integration of t w o or more instances of a psychological process possessing the same distinguishing characteristics, with the particular contents and the measurements of the action's intensity omittedâ€”on the principle that these omitted measurements must exist in some quantity, but may exist in any quantity (i.e., a given psychological process must possess some content and some degree of intensity, but may possess any content or degree of the appropriate category).[^3]
