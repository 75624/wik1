[[Idealism]] has long-claimed that [[Consciousness|consciousness]] (the "soul") is spiritual, divine, that it is a "[[Mysticism|mystic]] ingredient longing to escape the 'prison of the flesh'."[^1] This sets the false-dichotomy: either accept overt [[Mystics of Spirit|spirit mysticism]] by endorsing the consciousness *or* reject the consciousness and [[Reason|reason]] to be "scientific." 

>Despite [[Mystics of Muscle|their]] implicit mysticism, [[Materialism|materialists]] typically declare that their viewpoint constitutes the only scientific or naturalistic approach to [[Philosophy|philosophy]]. The belief in consciousness, they explain, implies [[Omnipotence|supernaturalism]]. \[...] the idealists invented the false alternative of consciousness *versus* science. The materialists simply take over this false alternative, then promote the other side of it. This amounts to rejecting arbitrarily the possibility of a naturalistic view of consciousness.[^2]
