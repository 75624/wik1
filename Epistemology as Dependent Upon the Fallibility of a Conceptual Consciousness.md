[[Epistemology]] provides man with guidance for his cognitive faculty, it tells man that he can gain [[Knowledge|knowledge]] only through specific means, [[Epistemology as Dependent Upon the Primacy of Existence|not how ever he feels]]. [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|Existence has primacy]] for all animals, of course, but man specifically has a [[Concept|conceptual]] [[Consciousness|consciousness]], which leads to a very important fact: [[Thought vs Evasion|his mind is not automatic]] [[The Validation of Free Will|or infallible]].

Given that man can err--that he can detatch his thinking from reality--means that man needs to discover a *method* of cognition, he needs to know how to use his mind and how to distinguish truth from falsehood, how to validate those conclusions he reaches. Namely, man needs *epistemology*.

>Epistemology is the science that tells a fallible, conceptual consciousness what rules to follow in order to gain knowledge of an [[Existence Exists|independent reality]]. Without such a science, none of man's conclusions, on any subject, could be regarded as fully [[Validation|validated]]. There would be no answer to the question: *how do you know?*[^1]

It is because man is fallible that he requires epistemology; if man was infallible and/or his consciousness automatic he would have no use for nor ability to use a method of validation.
