>There were once Western philosophers who upheld [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|the primacy of existence]]; notably, such ancient Greek giants as [[Parmenides]] and [[Aristotle]]. But even they were not consistent in this regard. (Aristotle, for example, describes his [[Aristotle's Unmoved Mover|Prime Mover]] as [[A Consciousness Conscious Only of Itself|a consciousness conscious only of itself]], which serves as the [[The Law of Causality|cause]] of the world's motion.) There has never yet been a thinker who states the principle explicitly, then applies it methodically in every branch of philosophy, with no concession to any version of its antithesis. This is precisely what [[Ayn Rand]] does. [[Objectivism|Her philosophy]] is the primacy of existence come to full, systematic expression in Western thought for the first time.[^1]
