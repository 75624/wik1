>The basic principle of concept-formation (which states that the omitted measurements must exist in *some* [[Quantitative|quantity]], but may exist in *any* quantity \[see: [[The Metaphysical Status of Concepts]]]) is the equivalent of the basic principle of algebra, which states that algebraic symbols must be given *some* numerical value, but may be given any *value*. In this sense and respect, perceptual awareness is the arithmetic, but *conceptual awareness is the algebra of cognition*.
>
>The relationship of concepts to their constituent particulars is the same as the relationship of algebraic symbols to numbers. In the equation $2a = a + a$, any number may be substituted for the symbol "$a$" without affecting the truth of the equation. For instance: $2 \times 5 = 5 + 5$, or: $2 \times 5,000,000 = 5,000,000 + 5,000,000$. In the same manner, by the same psycho-epistemological method, a concept is used as an algebraic symbol that stands for *any* of the arithmetical sequence of units it subsumes.

>Let those who attempt to invalidate concepts by declaring that they cannot find "manness" in men, try to invalidate algebra by declaring that they cannot find "$a$-ness" in $5$ or in $5,000,000$.[^1]
