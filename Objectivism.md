***Objectivism*** is the philosophy developed by [[Ayn Rand]] and derived from [[Aristotle]], which is based on the fact that [[Existence Exists|reality exists]] as an [[The Meaning of Objectivity|objective]] absolute, that man's mind--his [[Reason|reason]]--is is sole means of gaining knowledge of it, and that man needs [[Ethics|a rational morality]]. The *essential* characteristic of Objectivism as against every other philosophy is [[The Primacy of Existence as an Objectivist Innovation|the explicit identification and application of the primacy of existence]]. *Objectivity* means such an application---one is being *objective* in their activities if they are either implicitly or explicitly operating on the premise that [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|existence has metaphysical primacy over consciousness]].
