>"Content" here means the object of [[Consciousness|consciousness]], that of which it is aware, whether by [[Extrospection|extrospection]] or [[Introspection|introspection]]. Directly or indirectly, the object must be some aspect of existence; even states of consciousness can be grasped ultimately only in relation to the external world.[^1]
