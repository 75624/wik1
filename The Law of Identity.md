Implicit in the [[Axioms as Irreducible Primaries|axioms]] of [[Existence Exists|existence]] and [[The Axiom of Consciousness|consciousness]] is the law of identity: A is A. To be is to be *something* as against *other things* as against *other things*. The "identity" of an existent refers to that which it is, the sum of its attributes or characteristics---its *nature*. The fact identified here is subtly different than that identified in the axiom of existence: the latter distinguishes *something* from *nothing*, the former distinguishes *this* thing from *that* thing.

This law is, along with existence and consciousness, an axiom: a fundamental and inescapable starting point of knowledge. Wherever a man is studying something, he is studying some*thing* as against some other *thing*. The "*thing*" is the identification.
