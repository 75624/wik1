1. [[Mental Focus|Focus is volitional]];
2. [[Focus as Antecedent to Any Choice|focus is the logical antecedent of any other choice]];
3. the primary choice is whether to focus or drift.

Because focus/drift is a *primary* this means it does not rely on anything antecedent to it (within the [[Conceptual Consciousness|conceptual]] realm that is). You cannot reduce the choice to focus down to either prior choices made by the individual, or to their "social conditioning," or to their race, or to any other facts about them (this is implicit in the fact that it is a *choice*---choices cannot be *determined* by any other data). It is the *primary* choice. Of course, focus does depend on prior facts about reality, such as that the individual is [[Consciousness|conscious]] and that they exist, but these are not volitional---hence why focus is the *volitional* primary.

This is not to imply, either, that the *choice* of focus or drift is in some way *determined* by the fact that man is conscious, or that he exists---these are just prior requirements. It is still a *choice*, and in the hierarchy of choices, it is the primary.

>For the same reason, there can be no motive or [[Value-Judegment|value-judgment]] which precedes consciousness and which induces a man to become conscious. The decision to perceive reality must precede value-judgments. Otherwise, [[Value|values]] have no source in one's cognition of reality and thus become delusions. Values do not lead to consciousness; consciousness is what leads to values.

>In short, it is invalid to ask: why did a man choose to focus? There is no such "why." There is only the fact that a man *chose*: he chose the effort of consciousness, or he chose non-effort and unconsciousness. In this regard, every man at every waking moment is a prime mover.[^1]
