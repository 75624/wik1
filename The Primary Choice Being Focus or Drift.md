1. [[Mental Focus|Focus is volitional]];
2. [[Focus as Antecedent to Any Choice|focus is the logical antecedent of any other choice]];
3. the primary choice is whether to focus or drift.

Because focus/drift is a *primary* this means it does not rely on anything antecedent to it (within the [[Conceptual Consciousness|conceptual]] realm that is). You cannot reduce the choice to focus down to either prior choices made by the individual, or to their "social conditioning," or to their race, or to any other facts about them (this is implicit in the fact that it is a *choice*---choices cannot be *determined* by any other data). It is the *primary* choice. Of course, focus does depend on prior facts about reality, such as that the individual is [[Consciousness|conscious]] and that they exist, but these are not volitional---hence why focus is the *volitional* primary.

This is not to imply, either, that the *choice* of focus or drift is in some way *determined* by the fact that man is conscious, or that he exists---these are just prior requirements. It is still a *choice*, and in the hierarchy of choices, it is the primary.
