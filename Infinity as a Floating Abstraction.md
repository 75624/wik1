Treating "infinity" as an [[Actual|actual]] rather than a [[Potential|potential]] [[The Error of Conflating the Potential with the Actual|is an error]] (a [[Floating Abstraction|floating abstraction]])---there is no *actual* infinity. 

>"Infinite" does not mean large; it means larger than *any* [[Particular|specific]] quantity, i.e., of *no* specific quantity. An infinite quantity would be a quantity without identity. But [[The Law of Identity|A is A]]. Every [[Entity|entity]], accordingly, is finite; it is limited in the number of its qualities and in their extent; this applies to the universe as well. As [[Aristotle]] was the first to observe, the concept of "infinity" denotes merely a potentiality of indefinite addition or subdivision. For example, one can continually subdivide a line; but however many segments one has reached at a given point, there are only that many and no more. The *actual* is always finite.[^1]
