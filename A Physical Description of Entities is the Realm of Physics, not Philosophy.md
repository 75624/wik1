At various points in the history of philosophy going right back to the ancient Greek problem of finding "[[The One in the Many|the one in the many]]," a tendency has existed where [[Metaphysics|metaphysicians]] have attempted to elucidate the fundamental building blocks of reality---whether it be [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]' [[Monad (Leibniz)|monads]], or the fire of [[Heraclitus]]. These philosophers are mistaken in their task:
>The task of identifying the [[The Law of Identity|nature]] of physical objects as they are apart from [[Different Forms of Sense Perception does not Invalidate Sense Perception|man's form of perception]] does not belong to philosophy, but to [[Physics|physics]]. There is no philosophic method of discovering the fundamental attributes of matter; there is only the scientist's method of specialized observation, experimentation, and inductive inference. Whatever such attributes turn out to be, however, they have no philosophic significance, neither in regard to [[Metaphysics|metaphysics]] nor to [[Epistemology|epistemology]].[^1]
