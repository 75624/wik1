>The theory of a mind-body conflict, which has corrupted every branch and issue of philosophy, does have its root in a real conflict, but of a special kind. Its root is a breach between some men's consciousness and existence. In this sense, the basis of the theory is not reality, but a human error: the error of turning away from reality, of refusing to accept the absolutism of the metaphysically given.

>The man who follows and understands the opposite policy comes to the opposite conclusion: he dismisses out-of-hand the idea of a metaphysical dichotomy. A faculty of perception, he knows, cannot be an adversary of the world or the body; it has no weapons with which to wage any such war; it has no function except to perceive.[^1]
