[[The Objectivist Theory of Concept Formation as Valid|The Objectivist theory of concepts is the only valid theory of concept-formation]], here I will be explicating what it entails about the specifics of how a given [[Concept|concept]] is formed.

The very first [[The Levels of Consciousness|stage of awareness]] involved in the formation of concepts is that of [[Sensation|sensation]]. To move from this stage onto the level of [[Sense Perception|perception]] one must [[Differentiation|differentiate]] different [[The Metaphysical Status of Sensory Qualities|qualia]] and separate them out of the chaotic mess that is directly provided by the senses. These separated stimuli are then automatically [[Integration|integrated]] into distinct [[Entity|entities]]---we get not just "brownness," "smoothness," "woodenness," etc. as distinct information, but the specific *entity* that is a table (note: on this level the concept "table" does not yet exist---its just a *thing*, I highlight what it is that I am speaking about only such that the reader can understand what entity it is that is being integrated here).

Then, still on the perceptual level, it is possible for some higher animals to differentiate certain individual entities---*this* thing as against *that* thing. A dog can recognise his owner out of a crowd of people (and non-people, again, the dog has no concept "man" yet), because he has learned the specific attributes that his owner has as against those other entities with which he has become acquainted. 

These key processes of differentiation and integration are necessary also for the move from perceptual to [[Conceptual Consciousness|conceptual]]:

>We begin the formation of a concept by isolating a group of [[Particular|concretes]]. We do this on the basis of observed similarities that distinguish these concretes from the rest of our perceptual field. The similarities that make possible our first differentiations, let me repeat, are *observed*; they are available to our senses without the need of conceptual knowledge. At a higher stage of development, concepts are often necessary to identify similaritiesâ€”e.g., between two philosophies or two political systems. But the early similarities are perceptually given, both to (certain) animals and to men.[^1]

What makes man unique in this process of observing similarities between different entities is his power of [[Abstraction|abstraction]]---his ability to mentally separate out those relevant aspects of what he perceives from whatever other aspects are there. Man is capable of selectively focusing only on the attributes shared by all tables, and ignoring those that are not---man can ignore that different tables differ in their dimensions, their colour, their specific texture, etc., and focus only on what is essential to tableness. Animals are not capable of this process---the animal (at best) gains only the *observed* similarities embedded within an entire entity that cannot be cognitively ignored.

Once a man has separated these aspects out from a number of particulars and grouped them together, his cognitive task is not yet complete. In order to form a *concept* he must [[Integration|integrate]] this group---"blending all the relevant \[attributes] into an inseparable whole."[^2] This "mental entity"[^3] is then able to stand in for an infinite number of possible permutations that might be found[^4] in concrete examples in the future---we can now, when we see a new table immediately grasp it not as its own entirely unique particular, but as a *unit* of the *concept* "table." 

So, to summarise, the formation of a concept goes as follows:
1. [[Differentiation|differentiation]] of [[The Metaphysical Status of Sensory Qualities|qualia]] (e.g. "brownness," "smoothness," "woodenness.")---[[Sense Perception|perceptual]];
2. [[Integration|integration]] of differentiated qualia into [[Entity|entities]]---[[Sense Perception|perceptual]];
3. [[Differentiation|differentiation]] of entities (*this* thing as against *that* thing)---[[Sense Perception|perceptual]];
4. [[Abstraction|abstraction]] of differentiated entities---[[Conceptual Consciousness|conceptual]], and;
5. [[Integration]] of abstracted aspects into [[Concept|concepts]]---[[Conceptual Consciousness|conceptual]].

[^3]: [[Leonard Peikoff|Peikoff]]'s phrase, do note that concepts are not actual entities, they don't pop up in some "[[Plato's World of Forms|world of forms]]" after they have been generated---they exist purely in the mind of the man who has formed them.
[^4]: "Might be found" is key---we are dealing with the concept as standing in for infinite concretes, but [[Infinity as a Floating Abstraction|actual infinity is a floating abstraction]]. This is speaking here of a *[[Potential|potential]]*---you *might* come across extra examples of tables, and when you do you know that these belong to the same concept as the finite particulars that you have studied before. "Infinite" in this context, is referring to "open-endedness"---much like the set of numbers is "open-ended," i.e. you can keep listing off new numbers forever. To relate this [[Mathematics|mathematical]] analogy back to the theory of concepts---the concept "table" is open-ended in the sense that you can keep finding new examples of tables, and the nature of concepts is such that you can readily regard these new examples as units of the same concept without having to specify at the offset how many tables are included in the concept "table."
