A bundled philosophy is any philosophy that gives you [[Metaphysics|metaphysics]] (What is there?), [[Epistemology|epistemology]] (How do I know?), and [[Ethics|ethics]] (What should I do about it?) all in one neat bundle with the same answer to everything. [[Religion]] is a common example: *What is there?*---God is there; *How do I know?*---[[Mystics of Spirit|mystic]] contact with God; *What should I do about it?*---follow God's plan.
