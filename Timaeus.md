>In the *Timaeus* [[Plato]] presents an elaborately wrought account of the [[Primacy of the Supernatural Consciousness|formation of the universe]] and an explanation of its impressive order and beauty. The universe, he proposes, is the product of [[Reason|rational]], [[Teleology|purposive]], and beneficent agency. It is the handiwork of a divine Craftsman (“[[Demiurge]],” *dêmiourgos*, 28a6) who, imitating an unchanging and eternal model, imposes mathematical order on a preexistent [[Chaos|chaos]] to generate the ordered universe (*kosmos*). The governing explanatory principle of the account is teleological: the universe as a whole as well as its various parts are so arranged as to produce a vast array of good effects. For Plato this arrangement is not fortuitous, but the outcome of the deliberate intent of Intellect (*nous*), anthropomorphically represented by the figure of the Craftsman who plans and constructs a world that is as excellent as its nature permits it to be.[^1]
