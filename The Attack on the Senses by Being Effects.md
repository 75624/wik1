There have been various methods to [[The Attack on the Senses from their Limitation|attack the senses by them being limited]], one such method is by decrying that sensory impressions [[The Metaphysical Status of Sensory Qualities|are mere effects]] of the actual [[Entity|entities]] that we [[Sense Perception|perceive]]. This ignores that [[The Law of Identity|A is A]]--everything, including the senses and what they perceive, is what it is--and that from this we derive [[The Law of Causality|the law of causality]]---that sensory impressions refer to an interaction between an entity and a sense organ, the entity *causing* a certain response in the sense organ, does not imply that said sense impression is invalid. This certainly means that it [[Different Forms of Sense Perception Lead to Different Capabilities in Deducing Laws|is limited in its capacity]], but [[Different Forms of Sense Perception does not Invalidate Sense Perception|not that it is invalid]]---the effect must have a cause, that cause is a real [[Existence Exists|existent]], with real attributes that *cause* it to *effect* the sense organs in some particular way.

>Those who condemn the senses as deceptive on the grounds that sense qualities are merely effects on men are guilty of rewriting reality. Their viewpoint amounts to an ultimatum delivered to the universe: "I demand that the senses give me not effects, but irreducible primaries. That is how *I* would have [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|created reality]]." As in all cases of this fallacy, such a demand ignores the fact that what is [[Metaphysically Given|metaphysically given]] [[The Metaphysically Given as Absolute|is an absolute]]. [[Sense Perception|Perception]] is necessarily a process of interaction: there is no way to perceive an object that does not somehow impinge on one's body. Sense qualities, therefore, must be [[The Law of Causality|effects]]. To reject the senses for this reason is to reject them for existing---while yearning for a fantasy form of perception that in logic is not even thinkable.[^1]
