There is confusion within the history of philosophy over the correct [[Epistemology|epistemic]] ordering of the [[The Levels of Consciousness|levels of awareness]]: chronologically it is true that the [[Sensation|sensational]] is first, followed by the [[Sense Perception|perceptual]]---but this is not the correct ordering with respect to the science of epistemology.

> "\[Direct] experience," according to Objectivism, means the perceptual level of consciousness. As adults, as thinkers, and even as children beyond the infant stage, what we are given when we use our senses, leaving aside all conceptual knowledge, is the awareness of [[Entity|entities]]---nothing more, but nothing less.[^1]

In fact, it is the case that *starting from the perceptually given* it has taken a vast chain of scientific discoveries, an enormous amount of [[Induction|inductive]] and [[Deduction|deductive]] reasoning, to even discover the sensational level and to deduce that we must have at one point experienced the world in such a way. We needed to first start with the external stimuli--the [[Percept|percepts]]--*then* we could move onto the stage of abstracting to form [[Concept|concepts]], which *then* allowed us to uncover the existence of our own sensory apparatus, brain, and consciousness, and *then* we can begin to uncover the laws governing this whole setup, and *only then* we can finally conclude that the world must have at one point appeared as a chaotic mess. "That chaos, however, is not given to us as adults or philosophers. It is a sophisticated inference from what is given: the perceptual level."[^2]

For any given piece of knowledge that one has, the questions are: "what do I know?" and "how do I know?"---epistemology answers the latter question, the *how*? For you to have any information at all on anything, you must start with percepts--recall that your brain automatically integrates sensations into percepts--sensations are not themselves retained at all, and thus cannot form the basis of any chain of deduction---what you need is percepts, which *are* retained and are already bundled together, ready for further cognition.

>There are philosophers ([[David Hume]] is the most famous) who deny the perceptual level. Such men give the sensation stage epistemological primacy, then seek to determine whether the fact of entities (and causality) can be established by inference from it. This is a dead end; from disintegrated sensations, nothing can be inferred. A consciousness that experienced only sensations would be like the mind of an infant; it could neither perceive objects nor form concepts (which is one reason Hume ended as a paralyzed [[Scepticism|skeptic]]). Hume's dead end, however, is self-imposed. Entities do not require inferential validation. The given *is* the perceptual level.

>[[The Attack on the Senses from their Limitation|This last statement does not necessarily mean that the entities we perceive are metaphysical primaries]]; as we have seen, [[A Physical Description of Entities is the Realm of Physics, not Philosophy|that is a question for science]]. It means that the grasp of entities is an *epistemological* primary, which is presupposed by all other knowledge, including the knowledge of any ultimate ingredients of matter that scientists may one day discover.[^3]

Any philosopher who wishes to place the sensational as having epistemic primacy must himself rely on percepts being the given in his attempt to validate his thesis---he [[The Stolen Concept Fallacy|steals]] the primacy of perception in his attempt to dispute it.
