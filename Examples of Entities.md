As explained, an [[Entity|entity]] is [[Axioms as Irreducible Primaries|axiomatic]], and as such is defined *ostensively*. However, given [[The Characteristics of Entities|the characteristsics of entities]], we can elaborate on a few examples and non-examples to drive the [[Concept|concept]] home.

First, *fire* is not an entity. Fire is light and heat; it is a state of being *for* some entity---the entity is not the fire, but whatever is burning.

Despite what [[Randroid|Randroids]] [[The Randroid Theory of Abortion|would have you believe]], a baby in a womb *is* an entity, *it* is an *it* (which they cannot help but to implicitly admit in their discussion of babies, despite their attempted de-humanisation of them). A baby in a womb is not a state of being for the mother, the baby is an entity that will *die* (read **die** not *stop existing*) if it is detached and not preserved by some alternative means. You can discuss *this* fetus as against *that* fetus---the baby has [[The Law of Identity|identity]] even in its fetal state. When an item is burning, what this means is that it has gotten hot, is emitting light various gasses and whatnot---this is an aspect *of* the burning object. When a mother is pregnant, what this means is that she is *with child*---she is carrying *a* child in her womb. You could say that the pregnancy is a relationship between the mother *and* the child, but it is certainly not an aspect of the mother alone.

Sensory qualities are not entities, they are relationships between entities, see: [[The Metaphysical Status of Sensory Qualities]].
