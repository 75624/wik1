>_**The Communist Manifesto**_ (German: _Das Kommunistische Manifest_), originally the _**Manifesto of the Communist Party**_ (_Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei_), is a [[Politics|political]] pamphlet written by [[Marx|Karl Marx]] and [[Engels|Friedrich Engels]], commissioned by the Communist League and originally published in London in [[1848]]. The text is the first and most systematic attempt by Marx and Engels to codify for widespread consumption the core [[Historical Materialism|historical materialist]] idea that, as stated in the text's opening words, "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of [[Class Struggle|class struggles]]", in which [[Marxist Class Theory|social classes]] are defined by the relationship of people to the [[Factors of Production|means of production]]. Published against the backdrop of the [[The Springime of Nations|Revolutions of 1848]] and their subsequent repression across Europe, the _Manifesto_ remains one of the world's most influential political documents.[^1]
