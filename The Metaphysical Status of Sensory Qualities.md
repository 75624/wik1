If redness is man's form of [[Sense Perception|perceiving]] a certain object--a function of man's senses--can you say that redness is *real*---is it out there in the world of "[[Noumenal|things in themselves]]" apart from man, or is redness only in the mind? If it is the latter, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] [[The Kantian Attack on the Senses|would have us believe]], then the senses are deceivers---the object you are seeing isn't "really" red, the redness is only an illusion created by your mind, rather than anything in the object *itself*. Therefore you cannot know anything by [[Empiricism|empirical]] observation as any such observation or [[Reason|rational]] deduction therefrom can give you insight only into [[Phenomenal|a false world]] of your own creation. So where is red?

The question is invalid---a sensation is an interaction *between* two [[Entity|entities]], namely the object and the sensory apparatus of the subject. *Both* the physical object and the sense organ are necessary---when these two entities interact the form of perception is red. It is simply nonsense to ask where the form of perception is, just as it is nonsense to ask the same of any other relationship: where is "yesterday," where is "tomorrow," where is "to the left of," where is "above," where is "grandfather of," where is "daughter of," etc.? 

The form of perception is the mind's way of grasping the object in question, therefore it *cannot* be located in the object *apart from* the senses *or* in the senses *apart from* the object---it pertains rather to an interrelation between *both* the senses *and* the object of sensation.
