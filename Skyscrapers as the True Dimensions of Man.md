>"I like to see a man standing at the foot of a skyscraper," he said. "[[The Grand Canyon Argument|It makes him no bigger than an ant]]--isn’t that the correct [[Common Bromides|bromide]] for the occasion? The God-damn fools! It’s man who made it--the whole incredible mass of stone and steel. It doesn’t dwarf him, it makes him greater than the structure. It reveals his true dimensions to the world. What we love about these buildings, Dominique, is the creative faculty, the heroic in man."[^1]
