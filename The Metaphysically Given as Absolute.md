1. [[The Categories of Being|All action is action of entities]]
2. [[The Law of Causality|every entity has only one action available to it at any given time]]
3. therefore the [[Metaphysically Given|metaphysically given]] is absolute.

Because [[Existence Exists|existence exists]] there are no alternatives possible as far as [[Metaphysics|metaphysics]] is concerned---the [[Metaphysically Given|metaphysically given]] is immutable, *absolute*.

>"Absolute" in this context means necessitated by the nature of existence and, therefore, unchangeable by human (or any other) agency.[^1]

The necessary/contingent dichotomy is thus an error as far as metaphysics is concerned[^2]---it is said by such theorists that a fact is "necessary" if the alternative would involve a contradiction, or positively, a fact that obtains "by necessity" is one that obtains "by identity." Consider that [[The Categories of Being|all action is action of entities]] and [[The Law of Causality|every entity has only one action available to it at any given time]]; for there to be a metaphysical alternative--another "possible world"--would require that some set of [[Entity|entities]] [[Metaphysical Action|act]] in some alternative ways---ways not caused by their nature, or rather caused by incompatible aspects of their nature. But [[The Law of Identity|A is A]], so such other "possible worlds" is ruled out---to be *is* to be necessary.
