The dichotomy of "spiritual" vs "material" is the broadest form of various other dichotomies that result from [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|the primacy of consciousness]]. This dichotomy is represented in [[Plato|Plato's]] *[[The Timaeus on the Imperfection of Reality|Timaeus]]* where the [[Demiurge]] is said to be unable to shape the [[Chaos|chaotic]] world into a realm of beauty, hence [[The Timaeus on the Imperfection of Reality|reality is imperfect]]. Various other forms of this dichotomy include:[^1]
- "my dream vs. the actual which thwarts it;"
- "[[Inner vs Outer|the inner vs. the outer]];"
- "[[Value vs Fact|value vs. fact]];"
- "[[Moral vs Practical|the moral vs. the practical]];"
- [[The Mind-Body Conflict|the mind-body conflict]];
- [[Reason vs Emotion|reason vs emotion]].

>In due course, we will develop in detail the [[Objectivism|Objectivist]] position on the key aspects of the mind-body question. We will study the inner and the outer, value and fact, the moral and the practical, and several other such pairs, including reason and emotion, [[Concept|concepts]] and [[Percept|percepts]], pure science and technology, love and sex. In every such case, [[Ayn Rand]] holds, the conventional viewpoint is wrong; man does not have to make impossible choices between the "spiritual" side of life and the "material." The relationship between the two sides, she holds, is not clash or warfare, but integration, unity, harmony.[^2]
