The "libertarian" or "indeterminist" viewpoint on [[Free Will|free will]] accepts [[The Determinist-Indeterminist False-Dichotomy|the free will vs causality false-dichotomy]], taking the side of so-called "free will." The indeterminist accepts that freedom is a violation of [[The Law of Causality|causality]], and states that causality is therefore false under certain circumstances through the whim of [[God]], or some other such [[Miracles are a Metaphysical Impossibility|miracle]]. 

This viewpoint is not only false on the grounds that [[The Law of Identity|A is A]] and therefore causality stands, but it is further a deadly poison on the face of the believers in free will. Essentially every modern intellectual is a [[Determinism|determinist]], those that are not basically all accept the indeterminist position that God makes certain exceptions to causality in the special case of humans. This poisons the free will position by equating it with [[Mysticism|mysticism]]:

>Most of the traditional opponents of determinism have regarded free will as mystical, as an attribute of an otherworldly soul that is antithetical to science and to man's this-worldly [[Reason|reason]]. The classic expression of this viewpoint is the disastrous [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] slogan, "God, freedom, and immortality," which has had the effect of making "freedom" laughable by equating it with two [[Common Bromides|bromides]] of [[Omnipotence|supernaturalism]]. What reputable thinker cares to uphold [[Free Will|volition]] if it is offered under the banner, "ghosts, choice, and the Pearly Gates"?[^1]
