1. [[The Law of Identity|Everything is what it is]], [[Omnipotence|and is therefore limited]]
2. [[The Axiom of Consciousness|The senses exist]] (they *are*)
3. The senses are limited

>No type of [[Sense Perception|sense perception]] can register everything. A is A---and any perceptual apparatus is limited. By virtue of being able directly to discriminate one aspect of reality, a [[Consciousness|consciousness]] [[Different Forms of Sense Perception Lead to Different Capabilities in Deducing Laws|cannot discriminate some other aspect that would require a different kind of sense organs]]. Whatever facts the senses do register, however, *are* facts. And these facts are what lead a mind eventually to the rest of its [[Knowledge|knowledge]].[^1]
