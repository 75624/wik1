>[[Epistemology]] is based on the premise that man can acquire [[Knowledge|knowledge]] *only* if he performs [[Logic|certain definite processes]]. This premise means that a man cannot accept ideas at random and count them as knowledge merely because he feels like it. Why not?[^1]

The answer is in two parts, first knowledge is knowledge *of reality*, so [[Epistemology as Dependent Upon the Primacy of Existence|epistemology depends on the primacy of existence]]. Second, *human* [[Consciousness|consciousness]] in particular [[The Validation of Free Will|can err]] because man is a [[Concept|conceptual]] being, so man in particular [[Epistemology as Dependent Upon the Fallibility of a Conceptual Consciousness|needs to validate his conclusions]].
