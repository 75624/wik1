[[The Law of Causality]] relates an [[Entity|entity]] and its actions, some misinterpret this law as relating one action to another for instance asserting a [[Mechanistic|mechanistic]] notion of the motion of one billiard ball causing the motion of another, the implication being that we may dispense with the balls themselves and speak only of the motions. This idea is mistaken; the motions themselves do not act, rather they are the actions of the entities involved---it is the entities which act and cause. It is the billiard ball itself which acts and produces certain effects by certain means. 

>If one doubts this, one need merely substitute an egg or soap bubble with the same velocity for the billiard ball; the effects will be quite different.[^1]
