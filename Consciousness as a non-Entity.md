[[Consciousness]] is the faculty for perceiving that which exists---this means that consciousness *is not* an [[Entity|entity]]. [[The Characteristics of Entities|Entities are self-sufficient existents]]---consciousness is a faculty possessed by certain existents. Just as "red" or "hot" cannot exist on their own--apart from a thing that is red or hot--so too can "intelligent," "aware," "possessing a conceptual faculty," not exist on their own. [[The Attack on the Senses from their Limitation|This doesn't mean that consciousness lacks identity]]---[[Existence is Identity|existence is identity]], so every existent has identity, and consciousness certainly exists. Rather, what this means is that consciousness is not a *thing*---it is not a *he*, *she*, *it*, it is an attribute: this thing *has* consciousness---one of it's attributes is that it is aware of existence.
