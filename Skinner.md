**Burrhus Frederic Skinner** (March 20, [[1904]] â€“ August 18, [[1990]]) was an American [[Psychology|psychologist]], [[Behaviourism|behaviorist]], author, inventor, and [[Social Philosophy|social philosopher]]. Considered the father of Behaviorism, he was the Edgar Pierce Professor of [[Psychology]] at Harvard University from [[1958]] until his retirement in [[1974]].

Considering [[Free Will|free will]] to be an illusion, Skinner saw [[Human Action|human action]] as dependent on consequences of previous actions, a theory he would articulate as the _[[Principle of Reinforcement|principle of reinforcement]]_: If the consequences to an action are bad, there is a high chance the action will not be repeated; if the consequences are good, the probability of the action being repeated becomes stronger.
