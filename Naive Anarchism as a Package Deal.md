Properly understood, [[Anarcho-Capialism|anarchism]] is a [[Law|legal]] doctrine which prohibits [[Aggression|aggression]]. The naïve (or proto-) anarchist thesis lumps this in with the absence of hierarchy. We have a [[Package Deal|package deal]]: no aggression *and* no hierarchy. The two [[Concept|concepts]] do not belong together and must be analysed separately. Abolishing hierarchy would require that aggression be used against people who wish to form a hierarchy---hierarchy is a term that refers to the specific structure of society, aggression is a term that refers to a type of [[Human Action|action]], these are simply different areas of study. 

We might as well say that anarchism is a doctrine that opposes aggression *and* the eating of chocolate ice cream on Sunday---this example makes clear why these belong to different terms: anarchism and no-chocolate-ice-cream-on-Sunday-ism. The [[Anarcho-Frogism|anarcho-frogists]] make this same error: lumping the legal doctrine of anarchism within some other random [[Ethics|moral]] belief or [[Economics|economic]] preference that they hold "I am an anarchist who likes frogs, therefore I am an anarcho-frogist."
