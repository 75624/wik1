Consider what it would mean for the choice to focus or drift to be secondary to [[The Secondary Choice Being The Choice to Think or Evade|the choice to think or evade]]: this would involve a [[The Stolen Concept Fallacy|stolen concept]]. In order for one to either actively integrate or disintegrate [[Percept|percepts]] pre-supposes that one's mind is indeed *active*. The concepts of floating thought and evasion genetically depend upon the concept of focusing on the incoming sense data. For one to choose which bowl to place a ball in relies on the fact that they have previously picked up said ball.
