>The “stolen concept” [[Logical Fallacy|fallacy]], first identified by [[Ayn Rand]], is the fallacy of using a [[Concept|concept]] while denying the validity of its genetic roots, i.e., of an earlier concept(s) on which it logically depends.[^1]

In general a stolen concept is any concept that is implicitly relied upon in argumentation whilst being explicitly rejected.

>When modern philosophers declare that axioms are a matter of arbitrary choice, and proceed to choose complex, derivative concepts as the alleged axioms of their alleged reasoning, one can observe that their statements imply and depend on “existence,” “consciousness,” “identity,” which they profess to negate, but which are smuggled into their arguments in the form of unacknowledged, “stolen” concepts.[^2]
