>The idealists—figures such as [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Augustine]], [[Hegel]]—regard reality as a [[Spiritual vs Material|spiritual]] dimension transcending and controlling the world of nature, which latter is regarded as deficient, ephemeral, [[The Timaeus on the Imperfection of Reality|imperfect]]—in any event, as only partly real. Since "spiritual," in fact, has no meaning other than "[[Subjective|pertaining to consciousness]]," the content of true reality in this view is invariably some function or form of consciousness (e.g., [[Plato's World of Forms|Plato's abstractions]], [[Augustinian God|Augustine's God]], [[Hegelian Idealism|Hegel's Ideas]]). This approach amounts to [[The Primacy of Existence vs The Primacy of Consciousness|the primacy of consciousness]] and thus, as [[Ayn Rand]] puts it, to the advocacy of [[The Axiom of Consciousness|consciousness]] *without* [[Existence Exists|existence]].[^1]
