In the words of [[Ayn Rand]]: "[[Measurement|measurement]] is the identification of \[...] a [[Quantitative|quantitative]] relationship established by means of a standard that serves as a unit."[^1]

The "standard" in such a case is something like inches, or lbs, or dB, etc. This standard is subject to an act of choice--reality does not impinge upon us whether to use inches or meters--but there are requirements for such a standard to be [[Reason|rational]]:
1. the standard must represent the appropriate attribute---one cannot measure pressure with grams or velocity with inches;
2. the standard must be graspable by direct perception within the appropriate context---in determining the distance you must walk in the rain to get from your car to the front door it is ill-advised to use lightyears instead of feet or meters, and;
3. the standard must be immutable once selected---if kilograms refers not to some specifically specified mass but rather a different mass selected arbitrarily upon each new measurement, then it becomes impossible to perform calculations with it.

This is key to understanding why, on [[Objectivism]], a standard though freely chosen is not in any way "[[Subjective|subjective]]"---any rational unit refers to some specific concrete in reality that is what it is independent of any act of [[Consciousness|consciousness]]. Measurement and [[Mathematics|mathematics]] are not tasks performed by detaching one's cognition from reality and considering some [[Plato's World of Forms|Platonic super-reality]]---they are and must be rooted in the apprehension of this world.
